### 1.5 Relational Versus Document Databases Today

## 2 Query Languages for Data

### 2.1 Declarative Queries on the Web

### 2.2 MapReduce Querying

## 3 Graph-Like Data Models

### 3.1 Property Graphs

### 3.2 The Cypher Query Language

### 3.3 Graph Queries in SQL

### 3.4 Triple-Stores and SPARQL

### 3.5 The Foundation: Datalog

_Datalog_  is  a  much  older  language  than  SPARQL  or  Cypher,  having  been  studied extensively  by  academics  in  the  1980s  [44,  45,  46].
